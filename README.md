## Social Media Influencer Recommender System

Working with [Fohr](http://www.fohr.co) this project aims to recommend Instagram users based on the style and tone of their library of content. 

The newest content producers have large audiences and strong credibility. A product recommendation on social media is as close to word-of-mouth as possible, a fraction of the cost of traditional media, with very targeted audience. 

Fohr connects brands with influencers. Modern marketing departments are building relationships with social media personalities in order to advertise their products. But this new frontier is vast and uncontrolled. Fohr provides trust for brands and linfluencers and filters this world into credible players.

**Brief** 

Create a sophisticated recommendation system of the influencers on the Fohr platform.  Brand clients find the search for new partnerships to be cumbersome. Finding the perfect spokesperson for your brand is very challenging. 
This recommender system should consider 
 
 1. Explicit user data - 
A Brand will need to see users that fit basic criteria of follower count, gender, and region to reach their target demographic
 2. Image similarity - 
Brands have complicated art direction and will need to see a complicated mix of tone, style and quality in order to choose a new partnership
 3. Content - 
Of course, coffee brands will need to see recommendations from users who drink coffee just as beauty brands will need to users who wear makeup. This recommendation should consider the tone and unique mentions of each users captions and hashtags.
