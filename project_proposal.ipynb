    "\n",
    "This tool is intended to be used by clients of the agency to aid in a their search for media partnerships with new accounts. The agency currently has 75,000 infleuncer accounts with a wide variety of content types. Typically brands use this agency to find many accounts to work with simaltaneously, and searching through the roster can be very time consuming. This tool will not be intended to supplant human filter to check for accuracy, but should narrow the search. "
